I've spent longer than I thought before this blog come to reality. I bought the domain for at least a year or so! but at least it's here right now. I planned to move all my previous blogs hosted in * insert numbers of 'instant' bloggin platform here * to this [Github-hosted site] (http://github.com/danylaksono/danylaksono.github.io), so it may take another time until this blog will be fully operational.
